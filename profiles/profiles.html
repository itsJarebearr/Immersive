                               Hey, I'm Ash! I'm a student at Columbia College Chicago, majoring in marketing with a minor in creative writing. I commute from Morton Grove and spend a lot of my free time working on my comic,which blends my love for storytelling and visual art. Outside of school, I enjoy working out and collecting retro video games. I'm hoping to combine my writing and marketing skills in a creative career down the line.

                                My name Gianna Velardi, I am 19 years old in my second year at Columbia College Chicago. I am working towards my Bachelor's degree in photojournalism. I have always loved taking photos and have used the same Canon camera since I was 13. I also have been participating in a k-pop based dance group of Columbia students called C2K Dance since Sept 2023, while also photographing members for different concept images for promotion purposes. I hope to one day use my skills to emphasize the work of creative artists and their visions.

                                    Hi, I'm Joy. I'm a Junior Graphic Design student with a minor in UX design at Columbia College Chicago. I have been enjoying the classes and activities in Columbia, the professors are nice and professional, and I also met a lot of friends from different places. I enjoy the city vibe in Chicago, I always get a Dunkin before going to class. I love the school resources in Columbia. Studying in the computer lab, printing my work in the printing center, and hanging out with friends in the student center are the things I always do outside of class.
